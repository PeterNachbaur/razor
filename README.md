Keen Razor
==========

Because razors cut to the quick and that's what we want with monitoring or something.

### Usage

Get this bad boy installed to your local environment. You'll probably want to set up a virtualenv but that's up to you.

Then run this. There's one required argument and one optional argument.

##### Required: run-config

This is a config file in YAML that defines what monitoring job to run. Here's an example file:

```
name: kafkamon
topology: write-event
spoutroot: keen_storm_write_event_dev
maxdelta: 10000000
```

##### Optional: lib-config

This is a config file in YAML that defines settings like keen and sendgrid credentials. Here's an example file:

```
sendgrid:
    username: my_sendgrid_name
    password: a_thing
keen:
    project_id: project_id_here
    write_key: write_key_here
    read_key: read_key_here
```

##### How to invoke

python razor.py --run-config /path/to/run/config --lib-config /path/to/lib/config

That's it. Look at individual jobs to discover what parameters they support for their YAML files. We run this on
various servers by setting up cron jobs.
